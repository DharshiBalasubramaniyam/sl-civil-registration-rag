# RAG for Civil Registration Assistant in Sri Lanka

This project provides a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for answering queries related to civil registration in Sri Lanka, including the registration of births, marriages, and deaths. The system uses a combination of Pinecone for vector search and Google's Gemini AI for generating answers based on retrieved context.

## Overview

The Civil Registration Assistant project is designed to assist users with civil registration queries in Sri Lanka, such as how to register a birth, marriage, or death. It leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture that combines document retrieval and language generation for providing accurate answers.

- Data scraping: Data is scraped from the [Registrar General's Department - Sri Lanka](https://www.rgd.gov.lk/web/index.php?lang=en) website using selenium.

- Vector Search: Uses Pinecone for vector-based search and retrieval of relevant documents.

- Language Generation: Uses Google Gemini (Generative AI) for generating the final response based on retrieved documents.

- Language Support: Supports multiple languages including English, Sinhala, and Tamil.

## Features

- ✅ A clean, user-friendly web interface was built using Streamlit.

- ✅ LangChain is used to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline.
  
- ✅ Multi-language support (English, Sinhala, Tamil).

- ✅ Integration with Pinecone for high-performance vector search.

- ✅ Seamless generation of answers using Google Gemini AI.

- ✅ Scraping of civil registration data from the official Sri Lankan RGD website.

- ✅ Output in Markdown format for easy parsing and storage.
  
## Setup

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sl-civil-registration-rag.git
cd sl-civil-registration-rag
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the necessary packages, including:

- streamlit for the web interface.

- selenium for web scraping.

- Langchain for RAG pipeline.

- pinecone for vector search.

- google-cloud-translate for translation.

- google-generativeai for LLM-based responses.

### Environment Variables

Create a .env file at the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_CONFIG_PATH=path_to_your_google_translate_service_account_json
```

`GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google Cloud API key.

`PINECONE_API_KEY`: Your Pinecone API key.

`GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_CONFIG_PATH`: Path to your Google Translate API service account JSON file.

### Data Scraping

The project includes a script [`web_scraper/main.py`](./web_scraper/main.py) that scrapes the RGD website to gather civil registration documents in Markdown format.

```
python web_scraper/main.py
```
This will scrape the data and store it in the rgd_data folder. The data will be used to create an index in Pinecone for document retrieval.

### Running the Application

To start the application and interact with the system, run the following:

```
streamlit run main.py
```
This will start a local web server and you can access the assistant in your browser.

Features of the Web Interface
- Language Selection: The interface provides a radio button for selecting the language (English, Sinhala, or Tamil).

- Query Input: Users can input their queries into the text box.

- Response Display: The system will display the response generated by the AI model based on the retrieved documents.
